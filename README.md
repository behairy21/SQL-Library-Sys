# 📚 SQL Library Management System

This is a **Mini SQL Database Project** simulating a library system — designed to practice and apply database design, SQL queries, and stored procedures in a real-world context.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project represents a **Library Management System** built using **pure SQL** (SQL Server) and includes:

- Database schema creation
- Full ERD design
- Complex SQL queries
- Views, triggers, and stored procedures
- Use cases like borrowing, returning, calculating fines, access control, etc.

---

## 🧩 Features

- 🗂️ **Relational Schema & ERD**
  - Tables for books, students, employees, transactions, and more
  - Primary/foreign keys & constraints

- 🔍 **Query Collection**
  - SELECT with WHERE, LIKE, BETWEEN, IN
  - GROUP BY, HAVING, ORDER BY
  - INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN
  - Aggregate functions (COUNT, SUM, AVG...)

- 🔧 **Stored Procedures**
  - Borrow and return book logic
  - Insert/update/delete operations

- 👮‍♂️ **Triggers & Security**
  - Prevent unauthorized actions
  - Trigger-based validation

- 🧠 **User-defined Functions**
  - Calculate overdue fines
  - Format and simplify data presentation

- 🧪 **Data Integrity Tests**
  - Check referential integrity
  - Insert invalid records (test cases)

---

> Project is built and tested on **SQL Server (SSMS)**.

---

## 💡 Example Use Cases

- Borrowing a book and tracking due date
- Viewing all borrowed books by student ID
- Detecting overdue books and calculating fine
- Restricting employees from deleting critical data
- Testing referential integrity with invalid keys

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

- Practice relational modeling
- Write advanced SQL queries
- Understand triggers & stored procedures
- Simulate business logic using functions

---

## ✅ How to Use

1. Open SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)
2. Create a new database (e.g. `LibraryDB`)
3. Run the schema creation queries
4. Run the SQL queries, functions, and procedures from `Part 02`
5. Observe output and test edge cases
